Hello [Hiring Manager],

I specialize in building cloud-native applications on AWS (Lambda, SQS, SES, S3, Secrets) and integrating with Azure Graph for secure, automated workflows. My recent experience includes creating Lambda pipelines that transform multi-hour calls into structured consultation forms and automating onboarding/off-boarding with Azure Entra ID.

I enjoy working closely with teams to design systems that are maintainable, scalable, and cost-efficient. Based in Houston, Iâ€™m looking for hybrid/onsite roles where I can bring these strengths to your projects.

Thank you for considering my application.
