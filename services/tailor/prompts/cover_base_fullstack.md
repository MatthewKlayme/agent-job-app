Hello [Hiring Manager],

I’m a full-stack developer working with MERN and Hono/Bun, building scalable React apps and Node APIs backed by AWS (Lambda, SQS, SES, S3, Secrets, Cognito) and Azure (Graph API) integrations. Based in Houston, I’m looking for a hybrid/onsite role where I can contribute immediately.

Recent projects include delivering a secure React Native app for sensitive client data, automating onboarding/off-boarding via AWS Lambda + Azure Entra ID, and building serverless workflows with Bedrock AI.

I’d be excited to bring the same blend of problem-solving and delivery to your team. Thank you for your time.
