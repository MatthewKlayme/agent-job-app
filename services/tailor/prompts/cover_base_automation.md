Hello [Hiring Manager],

I’m an automation-minded engineer who builds workflows and scripts that connect modern web apps to AWS and Azure services. My work has included PowerShell + Azure Entra ID scripts for user lifecycle management, Lambda-driven document creation with Bedrock AI, and ReactJS portals to centralize processes.

I thrive on finding ways to reduce repetitive work, speed up delivery, and ensure reliability. Based in Houston, I’m looking for hybrid/onsite roles where automation can make an immediate impact.

I’d be happy to discuss how I can help streamline your workflows.
