Hello [Hiring Manager],

As a solutions-focused engineer, I’ve worked with teams to scope, design, and implement systems that solve real problems — from secure client communication apps to automated onboarding portals. I bring experience in MERN development, AWS serverless workflows, and Azure Graph integrations, with a strong focus on customer enablement.

In my recent role, I collaborated with non-technical teams to translate requirements into working solutions, reducing manual processes by half. I’m based in Houston and prefer hybrid/onsite work to maximize collaboration.

I’d value the opportunity to deliver the same kind of results for your clients.
