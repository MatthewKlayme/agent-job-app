Hello [Hiring Manager],

I design and deliver cross-platform mobile applications in React Native, often paired with Node/Hono APIs and AWS/Azure backends. My recent work includes an iOS/Android app for secure PII messaging, offline-capable designs, and AWS Lambda integrations for automated data processing.

I’m based in Houston and prefer hybrid/onsite opportunities where I can collaborate directly with stakeholders to refine UX and deliver reliable mobile solutions.

I’d welcome the chance to apply my skills to your mobile initiatives and help you reach your product goals.
